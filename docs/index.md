# Telemetry
This repo contains telemetry codes allowing to log, send and parse all sensors data flowing in Fenice.  
This software is able to send and receive data to clients over a wireless connection.  
[Telemetry App](https://github.com/eagletrt/telemetry-app) allows to communicate with telemetry.

## Introduction
A telemetry software must log every piece of information of a specific system.  
The data should be saved in a simple and easy to access format.  
From the data acquired it must be possible to do analisys to detect problems, improve performances or to integrate new features.  
An important feature is to notify as soon as a problem is detected, allowing for an immediate fix.
