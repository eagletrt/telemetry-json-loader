# Report
When a race finishes it is really important to have an analisys on how the car and the sensors behaved, if some sensors failed and if yes when and why.  
The best way to have a general view is via graphs.  
This telemetry feature generates a PDF report containing race informations and basic race stats (max speed etc...) and most importantly plots of every sensor, including GPS trajectories.  
[Here is an example](https://github.com/eagletrt/telemetry/tree/main/docs/Samples/Report.pdf)
